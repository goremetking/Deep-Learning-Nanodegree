# Deep-Learning-Nanodegree
Nanodegree course from Udacity. A repository to store all projects I worked on for this nanodegree.

Please view the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file for each project, which details the project and contains the trained network.

Neural networks were trained on an NVIDIA GTX 1080ti.

## Project 1: first-neural-network 
Implementing a neural network with Stochastic Gradient Descent and backpropagation. This neural network is then trained on data from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset), to predict bike ridership for a bike sharing system.

## Project 2: image-classification
Implementing a convolutional neural network using ReLU and dropout on one of the layers.

## Project 3: tv-script-generation
Implementing a recurrent neural network with LSTM cells and training it on scripts from Moe's Tavern in The Simpsons, and then generates its own script.

## Project 4: language-translation
Implementing a recurrent neural network using a sequence-2-sequence model and training it on a portion of English/French corpus to demonstrate translating from English to French.

## Project 5: face-generation
Using a Generative Adversarial Network to generate pictures of faces, employing convolutional neural networks for pictures from the MNIST and CelebA datasets.
