# Deep-Learning-Nanodegree
Nanodegree course from Udacity

Repository to store projects and notes from this course.

## first-neural-network 
Contains project 1:
Implementing a neural network with Stochastic Gradient Descent and backpropagation. This neural network is then trained on data from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset), to predict bike ridership for a bike sharing system.

## image-classification
Contains project 2:
Implementing a convolutional neural network using ReLU and dropout on one of the layers.

## tv-script-generation
Contains project 3:
Implementing a recurrent neural network with LSTM cells and training it on scripts from Moe's Tavern in The Simpsons, and then generates its own script.
