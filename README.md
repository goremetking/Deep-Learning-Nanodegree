# Deep-Learning-Nanodegree
Nanodegree course from Udacity

Repository to store projects and notes from this course.

first-neural-network folder contains project 1, implementing a neural network with Stochastic Gradient Descent and backpropagation. This neural network is then trained on data from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset), to predict bike ridership for a bike sharing system.
