# Deep-Learning-Nanodegree
Nanodegree course from Udacity

Repository to store projects that I have completed from this course.

## first-neural-network 
### Project 1:
Implementing a neural network with Stochastic Gradient Descent and backpropagation. This neural network is then trained on data from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset), to predict bike ridership for a bike sharing system.

## image-classification
### Project 2:
Implementing a convolutional neural network using ReLU and dropout on one of the layers.

## tv-script-generation
### Project 3:
Implementing a recurrent neural network with LSTM cells and training it on scripts from Moe's Tavern in The Simpsons, and then generates its own script.

## language-translation
### Project 4:
Implementing a recurrent neural network using a sequence-2-sequence model and training it on a portion of English/French corpus to demonstrate translating from English to French.

## face-generation
### Project 5:
Using a Generative Adversarial Network to generate pictures of faces, employing convolutional neural networks for pictures from the MNIST and CelebA datasets.
